# NCHHO_OptimizationAlgorithm_IoV_Application
NCHHO uses chaotic and nonlinear control parameters to improve HHO’s optimization performance. The main goal of using the chaotic maps in the proposed method is to improve the exploratory behavior of HHO. In addition, this paper introduces a nonlinear control parameter to adjust HHO’s exploratory and exploitative behaviours. The proposed NCHHO algorithm shows an improved performance using a variety of chaotic maps that were implemented to identify the most effective one, and tested on several well-known benchmark functions. Also, this work considers solving an Internet of Vehicles (IoV) optimization problem that showcases the applicability of NCHHO in solving large-scale, real-world problems.

**Important to note:**
We have divided the code into two folders. The first folder contains the source code about the 23 benchmark functions solved by the NCHHO, and the second contains the source code about our proposed algorithm for solving the IoV problem. The second code maximized the objective function for the IoV problem and should be separated. Therefore, we couldn't put them in the same folder.
